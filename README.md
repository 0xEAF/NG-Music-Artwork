# NG Music Artwork

This extension adds the music artwork to the audio listen page (because why isn't this a thing already?).

## Installation

### On Firefox (easiest)

The extension is published on the Mozilla Add-Ons store:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ng-music-artwork/

### On Chrome, Brave, and others

It is unfortunately not possible for me to publish it to the Google Chrome Webstore, because I don't want to pay the $5 fee AND still have to show Google my government ID to publish a f*cking extension, WHYY??

There are two ways to work around this, here's the first:

1. Open [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions)
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Download the [latest CRX files from the releases](https://github.com/0xEAF/NG-Music-Artwork/releases)
4. Drag and drop the CRX file into the Chrome extension manager window
5. Click "Add extension"
6. Click on "dangerous extension detected" pop-up warning
7. Click the triple dots and select "keep this extension"
8. Disable developer mode

However, **this may not work on some systems** (personally, Brave on Linux worked fine but not Brave on Windows) so instead here's method 2:

1. Open [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions)
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Download the [repo as a ZIP file](https://github.com/0xEAF/NG-Music-Artwork/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
4. Extract the ZIP file anywhere
6. Click "Load unpacked extension"
7. Select the extracted folder and click OK
8. **Do NOT disable developer mode, ever** (which, I think, shouldn't even be a problem in most cases if you aren't stupid)

> ### NOTE
> You will have to do one of these methods at each update, and there is no way to automatically check for one or update the extension automatically.

### For Opera and Edge

Currently it is impossible for me to publish the extension to the Opera Add-Ons or Edge Add-Ons store because their account set-up is just impossible to finish for some reason (it just never finishes loading), so you'll have to follow the Chrome instructions.
