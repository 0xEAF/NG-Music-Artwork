# HG Music Artwork

This extension adds the music artwork to the audio listen page (because why isn't this a thing already?).

## Installation

### On Firefox (easiest)

The extension is published on the Mozilla Add-Ons store:

https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/ng-music-artwork/

> ### NOTE
> The extension is currently **being verified by the folks at Mozilla**. For that time, the link will not work.
> I will remove this warning when the extension will be validated and published on Mozilla Add-Ons.

### On Chrome, Brave, and others

It is unfortunately not possible for me to publish it to the Google Chrome Webstore, because I don't want to pay the $5 fee AND still have to show Google my government ID to publish a f*cking extension, WHYY??

The only way to get it is this one:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Download the [latest CRX files from the releases](https://github.com/0xEAF/NG-Music-Artwork/releases)
4. Drag and drop the CRX file into the Chrome extension manager window
5. Click "Add extension"
6. Click on "dangerous extension detected" pop-up warning
7. Click the triple dots and select "keep this extension"
8. Disable developer mode

NOTE: You will have to do this at each update, and there is no way to automatically check for one or update the extension automatically.

### For Opera and Edge

Currently it is impossible for me to publish the extension to the Opera Add-Ons or Edge Add-Ons store because their account set-up is just impossible to finish for some reason (it just never finishes loading), so you'll have to follow the Chrome instructions.
